**Description**

This public repository contains the Java source code for the algorithms and clients 
in the textbook Algorithms, 4th Edition by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne. 

Solutions to the exercises of the Algorithms book by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne (4th editon).


I found the book to be an excellent resource to learning algorithms and data structures. 
Since there are not many (almost none) solutions of the exercises on the Internet and 
the only ones I've found are either incomplete or require a payment to be accessed, 
I decided to share my work on the exercises so far. Hopefully that will help students 
and professionals to validate their exercise solutions and learn more about the book content.

There may be mistakes, but to the best of my knowledge, these solutions are correct.

Many of these exercises are used as homework assignments in universities. If you have to 
do any of these exercises as homework make sure you understand the problem and solution 
instead of simply copying it. Understanding these algorithms and data structures will be 
extremelly valuable in your career.

This is a work in progress. I am updating this repository as I finish the exercises.
